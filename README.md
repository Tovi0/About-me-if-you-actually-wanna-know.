I don't know how to do this properly. so I'll just do this here.

Hi. I'm Tovio. I am a HUGE fan of TF2. I've been in the fandom for 5 years now and love to talk about it... maybe a little too much. So you've been warned. I also like Dandy's world, though it's not as intense.

I like short, friendly conversation. I get nervous if the silence drags on for too long. As mentioned before, I'm an adult in my 20's and am uncomfortable with spontaneous shipping and/or cuddling. I'd rather that be reserved for close friends. Please do not excessively kiss me either; even if you like my skin. I appreciate the compliment truly... it just gets a but much.

My DNI: The basics of course. Anyone who jokes about and/or discusses sexual topics in the safe zone publicly or make inapropriate ponies in general. This includes characters of the NR or USSR. (talking to you CountryHuman fandom.) Proshippers and people who ship real people. People who think it's okay to self-diagnose and speak for the community they're infiltrating or think diagnosis is a privilage. (This goes for self diagnosed autistics and systems especially.)

Side note: Medic TF2 ponies... Please leave me alone if the only reason you like the character is because you depict him as abusive. He, as a character, makes me uncomfortable in general. If you can, please refrain from cuddling/kissing me as him. 

(I'm usually seen alone or cuddling with my close friends. I'm Aro/Ace and cuddle my friends with hearts sometimes. I don't have/want a partner.
I also like stealing marshmallows and grapes ((hehehe)).)
